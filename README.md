# SwiftUI MVVM Navigation Example

This repository contains a fully functional SwiftUI application designed to demonstrate an effective way of implementing navigation using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. By integrating `NavigationStack` while keeping a clean separation between the ViewModel and View layers, this example showcases a practical solution to a common challenge faced in SwiftUI app development.

Project Overview
----------------

The example project illustrates a navigation framework within a SwiftUI application, using `NavigationStack`, `RootViewModel`, and a custom `NavigationCoordinator` protocol. This approach aims to maintain the MVVM architectural integrity, promoting a structured and testable codebase.

### Key Features

*   Demonstrates the use of `NavigationStack` in SwiftUI.
*   Implements MVVM architecture for clear separation of concerns.
*   Provides a scalable solution for complex navigation flows.
*   Includes unit tests showcasing how to test navigation logic.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

*   Xcode 15.x
*   Swift 5
*   iOS 16, iOS 17


Usage
-----

Explore the app to see how navigation between different views is handled within the MVVM framework. Pay special attention to the `RootViewModel`, `NavigationCoordinator` protocol, and how each view model interacts with the `NavigationStack` for seamless navigation.
